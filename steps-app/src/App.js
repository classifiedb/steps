/**
 * State in React: most important in React
 * State - is data that a component can hold over time, necessary for information that it needs to remember throughout the app's lifecycle
 *    * "component's memory"
 *
 * "state variable" / "piece of state": A single variable in a component (component state)
 *
 * - updating component state triggers React to re-render the component
 *
 *  ** state keeps data in sync with the UI (state is a tool. Mastering state will unlock the power of React development) state allows developers to:
 * 1 - update the component's view (by re-rendering it)
 * 2 - persist local variables between renders
 *
 * React is all about immutability; do not manually change the state but use setter functions
 *
 *
 *
 * THE MECHANICS OF STATE IN REACT
 * - we don't do direct DOM manipulations in react because react is declarative
 *
 * How is component view updated then? - In react, a view is updated by re-rendering the component
 * - In React, a view is updated by re-rendering the component
 * - A component is re-rendered when its state is updated
 * - So to update view, we update state
 *
 * React is called "React" because - React REACTS to STATE changes by re-rendering the UI
 *
 * Frameworks exist to keep data in sync with the User Interface (we just seen how react does it)
 *
 *
 *
 * ONE COMPONENT, ONE STATE
 * - Each component has and manages its own state, no matter how many times we render the same component
 *
 * UI AS A FUNCTION OF STATE
 *  UI = f(state )
 * react is a constantly change of state over time and correctly displaying the state
 *
 *
 * IN PRACTICAL TERMS
 * -use a state variable for any data that a component should keep track of ("remember") over time. This is data that will change at some point. In Vanilla JS, that's a let variable, or an [] or {}
 *
 * - whenever you want something in the component to be dynamic, create a piece of state related to that "thing", and update the state when the "thing" should change (aka "by dynamic")
 *    Example: A modal window can be open or closed. so we create a state variable isOpen that tracks whether the modal is open or not. On isOpen = true we display the window, on isOpen = false we hide it
 *
 * - If you want to change the way a component looks, or the data it displays, update its stat. This usually happens in an event handler function
 *
 * - When building a component, imagine its view as a reflection of state changing over time.
 *
 * - (Beginners mistake) For data that should not trigger component re-renders, don't use state. Use a regular variable instead.
